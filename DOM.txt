how you are structuring your web element 


any peice of code that is very common and used multiple times : boiler plate code !
The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified 
with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
 Every element in a document—the document as a whole, the head, tables within the document, 
 table headers, text within the table cells—is part of the document object model for that document, so they can all 
 be accessed and manipulated using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript.
 
 
 API (HTML or XML page) = DOM + JS (scripting language)
 
  different data types being passed around the API
 :
 
 1.Document object : root document object itself 
 2.element : 
 3. nodeList : array of elements 
 4.Attribute : object reference that exposes a special (albeit small) interface for attributes. 
 5.NamedNodeMap :
